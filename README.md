[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fmpds-io%2Fmpds-aiida.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fmpds-io%2Fmpds-aiida?ref=badge_shield)


## Rationale

- get accurate encyclopedic, reference, and benchmarking scientific data
- get vast systematic training data for machine learning
- use the cheap commodity cloud environment (_not_ the HPC cluster)
- ensure provenance tracking and reproducibility of simulations with AiiDA


## Installation

The code in this repo requires the [aiida-crystal-dft](https://github.com/tilde-lab/aiida-crystal-dft), [yascheduler](https://github.com/tilde-lab/yascheduler), and [mpds-ml-labs](https://github.com/mpds-io/mpds-ml-labs) Python packages installed. In their turn, they depend on the [aiida](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core), [mpds_client](https://github.com/mpds-io/mpds_client), and other Python packages.

Thus, installation is as follows (replace `pip` with `pip3` if needed and mind virtual env):

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/tilde-lab/aiida-crystal-dft
pip install git+https://github.com/tilde-lab/yascheduler
pip install git+https://github.com/mpds-io/mpds-ml-labs
git clone https://github.com/mpds-io/mpds-aiida
pip install mpds-aiida/
```

Here some reader's AiiDA experience is assumed. Note, that the AiiDA as of *version 1.1.0* does _not_ support cloud environments, so the custom cloud scheduler engine [yascheduler](https://github.com/tilde-lab/yascheduler) should be used. This scheduler manages the [CRYSTAL](http://www.crystal.unito.it) simulation engine at the cloud VPS instances and encapsulates all the details, concerning the remote *computer* task submission, queue, and results retrieval, as well as the VPS management. This scheduler runs its own daemon and lives together with the AiiDA at the same machine. However, AiiDA considers it as a remote service, accessible via the `ssh` transport, so the command `ssh $USER@localhost` should pass. To achieve that, the reader might run _e.g._:

```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh $USER@localhost
```
(Note, that the AiiDA should be aware of the `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` key file while SSH setup!)

For simplicity the `yascheduler` can share the database with AiiDA. Setting up the `yascheduler` looks like:

```shell
vi /etc/yascheduler/yascheduler.conf
yainit
service yascheduler start
```

The AiiDA should be set up normally, and the stub remote *computer* (_e.g._ `cluster: yascheduler`), as well as the stub CRYSTAL *code* (_e.g._ `codes: Pcrystal`) should be added:

```shell
reentry scan
verdi setup
verdi computer setup
verdi computer configure ssh $COMPUTER
verdi computer test $COMPUTER --print-traceback
verdi code setup
```

Why stub? Because the *computer* and *code* management is delegated to the `yascheduler`, taking care of the on-demand cloud resources management.

The Gaussian basis sets used by CRYSTAL engine should be added to the AiiDA database. We download the entire basis set library from the [CRYSTAL website](http://www.crystal.unito.it/basis-sets.php) and save some selected basis sets as `*.basis` files using the script `scripts/run_get_unito_bsl.py`. Then, in a subfolder with the `*.basis` files, one runs:

```shell
>> verdi data crystal_dft uploadfamily --name=$BASIS_FAMILY
```

or, to add the internal basis sets predefined in CRYSTAL:

```shell
verdi data crystal_dft createpredefined
```

Then the desired name ($BASIS_FAMILY) should be used in the calculation settings inside `mpds_aiida/calc_templates` (see below).


## Usage

The [MPDS platform](https://mpds.io) is the main data source for generating the simulation inputs and checking the simulation results. An access to the binary compounds data subset is free, one should [login at the MPDS](https://mpds.io/#modal/login) and get the MPDS API key:

```shell
export MPDS_KEY=...
```
(Please do not forget to withdraw _i.e._ invalidate the API key after finishing the work.)

A template system is used to control the calculation parameters, see the `mpds_aiida/calc_templates` subfolder. Note, that the `options: resources` template directive makes no sense with our custom cloud scheduler. The `cluster`, `codes`, and `basis_family` template directives have to be specified exactly as defined above.

The following on-demand cloud providers are currently supported (resp. `yascheduler` directives given in brackets):

- [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) (`hetzner_token`, `hetzner_max_nodes`), API token must be issued for a project
- [Upcloud](https://upcloud.com) (`upcloud_login`, `upcloud_pass`, `upcloud_max_nodes`), API permissions are set in account settings

At the moment of writing, the chosen default Hetzner configuration (CX51) runs a test task for **2-2.5 hours** on average and costs **EUR 35.88** per month, the chosen default Upcloud configuration (8 cores, 4Gb memory) runs a test task for **1.5 hours** on average and costs **$89** per month.

More examples are given in the `scripts` subfolder.

An operation principle is briefly illustrated below.
